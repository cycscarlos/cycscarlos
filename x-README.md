            "I worked for more than 25 years as a software engineer in IBM Mainframe technologies;
             implementing high technical level projects in more than 25 corporate companies; including
             12 national banks and one abroad. Subsequently, I developed a successful career as a
             project engineer, in the areas of telecommunications (my academic specialization) and
             electronic security systems; implementing lots of projects in more than 30 industries
             and corporate companies, some of the likes of Cargill Venezuela, PDVSA, Metro de Caracas,
             CANTV, Movistar, among many others. In parallel, (since the beginning of 2020), I am also
             developing a successful career as a web developer, developing web, mobile and server
             applications."

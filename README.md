            "We are constantly prepared to remake ourselves. I want to motivate you and
            encourage you to pursue your aspirations.

            I have been hired by more than 40 large companies and corporations to advise
            and support them in developing and implementing complex technical projects in
            the IT field.

            I worked for over 25 years as a system programmer and IBM mainframe technology
            specialist. After that phase ended, I specialized in microwave telecommunications
            and electronic security systems, a field in which I have been working for over 20
            years, developing essentials and large projects.

            Throughout my professional career, I founded two successful startups, each
            dedicated and specialized in providing services for the technologies for which
            they were created.

            Finally, and as a complement to my vocation as a software developer, in my free
            time, I develop websites and applications for desktop computers, servers, and
            smartphones. This passion requires me to stay updated on new technologies and
            trends within the web software development ecosystem such as Python, Javascript,
            HTML, CSS, NodeJS, MySQL, MongoDB, APIs, Artificial Intelligence, etc."

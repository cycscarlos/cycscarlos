            "I worked for more than 20 years as a software engineer in IBM Mainframe technologies;
             implementing high technical level projects in more than 25 corporate companies; including
             12 national banks and one abroad. Subsequently, I developed a successful career as a
             project engineer, in the areas of telecommunications (academic specialization) and
             electronic security systems; implementing lots of projects in more than 30 industries
             and corporate companies, some of the likes of Venezuela, Metro de Caracas, CANTV, Movistar,
             among many others. At parallel, I also developed a successful career as a web developer,

<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:10px">
            Electronic engineer; I worked for more than 25 years as a system
            programmer with IBM Mainframe technologies (i.e. s/370, s/390, z/Series).
            During that stage, I provided technical consulting services in
            numerous engineering projects for more than 25 biggest companies;
            much of them, included more than ten banks, both nationals as international
            scene. During the last 20 years, and in parallel, I developed a successful
            career as a project engineer; designing and implementing microwave
            telecommunication networks, as well as industrial electronic
            security systems in more than 30 corporate companies; some of the
            likes of PDVSA, Cargill de Venezuela, Metro de Caracas, CANTV,
            Movistar, among many others. Recently (since the beginning of 2020),
            and as a professional compliment, I have started to work
            in a new and dynamic career as a "full-stack" web software
            developer, by the moment, in progress!

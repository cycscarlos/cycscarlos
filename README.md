            Electronic engineer; I have more than 30 years working on as a system
            programmer or Software Engineer with IBM Mainframe technologies (s/370,
            s/390, z/Series). During that stage, I have been provided technical
            consulting services to +25 companies, which included 12 banks, both
            national and international, in the implementation of many high-level
            technical IT projects. In parallel and during the last 15 years, I am
            developed a successful career as a project engineer, designing and
            implementing microwave networks and industrial electronic security
            systems in more than 30 huge companies; some of the likes of PDVSA, 
            Cargill, CANTV, Movistar, Metro de Caracas, among many others. I still
            render top-level consulting and project field implementation services 
            at the electronic security systems and wireless networks technologies.
            Although, recently (since early 2020), I have been training and working
            on a new and exciting career as a web software developer; design, and
            developing websites, backend systems, and small and specific apps.
            In that way, this awesome roundtrip also brings me up to gives
            advocate technical tips to the spanish developer communities via
            social media networks, and I am enjoying it a lot!

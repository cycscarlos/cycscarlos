<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:10px">
          Electronic engineer; I have worked for more than 30 years as a software engineer (or system programmer) on IBM Mainframe systems (s/370, s/390, z/Series). During that stage, I have provided technical consulting services for the development and implementation of complex technical projects, in the system programming and telecommunications areas, for more than 25 companies, including 12 banks, both nationally and internationally.
          
          In parallel, and during the last 20 years, I have developed a successful career as a project engineer; designing and implementing electronic security systems and microwave networks in the telecommunication area, with high level and industrial quality, in more than 30 corporate (and huge) companies; some of them of the stature of PDVSA, Cargill de Venezuela, Metro de Caracas, CANTV, Movistar, among many others.
          
          Recently (since early 2020), and as a professional compliment, I have started an exciting and dynamic career as a web software developer,  design, and developing websites, backend systems, and small and specific apps. In that way, this awesome roundtrip also brings me up to gives advocate technical tips to the Spanish developer communities via social media networks.

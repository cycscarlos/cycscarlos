<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:10px">
            Electronic Engineer, 1981. I worked for
            more than 20 years as a software engineer in IBM Mainframe
            technologies, providing consulting services and technical
            support to more than 25 companies, including 12 banks,
            in the implementation of complex technical projects (system
            programming and telecommunications areas). During that period,
            among other functions, I also was Director of System Software of the
            Venezuelan subsidiary of Computer Associates, Inc, an American
            corporation, based in the USA, specialized in software development.
            As part of my constant evolution process, and during the last 22 years, I
            developed a successful career as a project engineer, in the areas of
            electronic security systems and telecommunications, implementing
            numerous projects in more than 30 corporate companies; some of the
            likes of PDVSA, Cargill de Venezuela, Metro de Caracas, CANTV,
            Movistar, among many others. More recently, and taking advantage of
            the pandemic, since early 2020, I'am began to formally train in the
            dynamic technologies that make up the ecosystems of web development,
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science, becoming an
            enthusiastic web developer, with a broad spirit of collaboration and
            activity within the Spanish-speaking web community. I have acquired
            strong skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Go, React, Django,
            Figma, Git, NodeJS, etc.

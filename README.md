              "Carlos Colmenares A here. I've always worked as a software engineer even though I'm an electronic engineer. We constantly recreate ourselves on time. I want to encourage you to pursue your aspirations. I worked as a microwave communications network project specialist for almost 20 years after spending over 25 years as an IBM Mainframe system programmer. I also co-founded two tech start-ups during this time. In more than forty (40) domestic and international corporations, I have provided consulting services for the creation of highly technical IT projects. I've been creating websites, mobile apps, and server platform systems since the year 2020 because I love to code."

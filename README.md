              "Carlos Colmenares A is who I am. I've always been a software engineer,
              despite being an electronic engineer. We are constantly prepared to remake
              ourselves. I want to motivate you and encourage you to pursue your aspirations.
              I worked with IBM for nearly 25 years as a mainframe system programmer, and then
              for another 20 years as a microwave telecommunication network project specialist.
              I also co-founded two tech start-ups during that time. I have provided consulting
              services for the creation of highly technical IT projects for more than forty (40)
              domestic and international businesses. I've been creating websites, mobile apps,
              and server platform systems since 2020, when I first became enthusiastic and
              passionate about coding."

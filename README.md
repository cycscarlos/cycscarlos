            IBM-Mainframe technologies, software engineering, and AI-Data science specialist.

            I worked for over +25 years as a system programmer, and specialist for
            
            IBM's mainframe technologies.. Later, I specialized in microwave
            telecommunications networks, and electronic security systems, a 
            field in which I have been working for over 20 years developing 
            important and complex projects.

            I have been hired by dozens of companies and corporations to give them
            support and consulting in the implementing of complex technical projects 
            in the computing, networking, and electronics security systems areas.

            As enthusiastic fullstack software programmer, I develop professional
            websites and apps for desktop and smartphones. This passion requires me
            to stay updated on new technologies and trends within the web's software
            development ecosystem. My preferred software development stack is; for the
            IBM-Mainframes: Assembler, Cobol, VSAM, CICS, VTAM & NCP | for the web:
            HTML, CSS, Javascript, Pyton, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MySQL...

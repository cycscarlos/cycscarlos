            "Electronic engineer, specialized in software engineering. I worked for over
            25 years as a system programmer, and specialist for IBM's mainframe technologies.
            Later, I specialized in microwave telecommunications networks, and electronic
            security systems, a field in which I have been working for over 20 years, developing
            important and complex projects.

            I have been hired by more than tens of companies and corporations to give them
            support and consulting in the implementing of complex technical projects in the
            computing, networking, and electronics security systems areas.

            As well, I develop professional websites and apps for desktop and smartphones.
            This passion requires me to stay updated on new technologies and trends within
            the web software development ecosystem, therefore I have become an eternal student."
